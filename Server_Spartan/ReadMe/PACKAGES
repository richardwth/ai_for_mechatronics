[lev@spartan ~]$ python --version

# In addition to the system Python there are different versions with different compiler toolchains. across the v2 and v3 releases. To load a specific version, use the `module load` command. e.g.,

[lev@spartan ~]$ module avail Python/
[lev@spartan ~]$ module load Python/3.5.2-goolf-2015a

# To determine the modules installed in a particular version run the following from within Python.

import pip
installed_packages = pip.get_installed_distributions()
installed_packages_list = sorted(["%s==%s" % (i.key, i.version)
     for i in installed_packages])
print(installed_packages_list)

# To add a new package added to a version of Python contact `hpc-support@unimelb.edu.au`, to have the package added. An alternative (less efficient but sometimes necessary) is to install the package locally. The following is one of several methods that could be used.
